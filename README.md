# How to use Hammer++ with Garry's Mod

## Why did I create this?
The answer is pretty simple... I hate myself. No, but really I saw a lot of people struggling to install Hammer++ itself but they had more problems with installing it for Garry's Mod, so this is a way I found to make it work.

## Requirments
- Computer running Windows^ 10 (20H2) or newer
- [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/)
- [Garry's Mod](https://store.steampowered.com/app/4000)
- Source Games
	- [Counter-Strike: Source](https://store.steampowered.com/app/240)
	- [Half-Life 2](https://store.steampowered.com/app/220)
	- [Half-Life 2: Deathmatch](https://store.steampowered.com/app/320)
	- [Half-Life 2: Episode One](https://store.steampowered.com/app/380)
	- [Half-Life 2: Episode Two](https://store.steampowered.com/app/420)
	- [Half-Life 2: Lost Coast](https://store.steampowered.com/app/340)
	- (Optional) [INFRA](https://store.steampowered.com/app/251110)
	- (Optional) [Black Mesa](https://store.steampowered.com/app/362890)
- Source SDK 2013 Multiplayer
- (Optional) [Slammin' Tools](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/17pQY8wDkednZi0kMZOSpAtNBNmFWm6GJ)
- [Hammer++](https://ficool2.github.io/HammerPlusPlus-Website/index.html)

### ^Windows versions compatibility
Windows is required to run Hammer++, as other OSes are not fully supported by Valve thus hammer is not available for any other OS than Windows. When it comes to specific version there is none, I have personally tested it on Windows 10 Pro version 20H2 build 19042.928 and all the versions until Windows 10 Pro version 21H2 build 19044.1526 (being the newest version available in public channel as of time of writing this). That being said, since I published this guide almost a year ago, people have followed it and succeeded in installing it on many diffrent windows versions including windows 11.

## How to install requirments?
In this tutorial I assume you have Garry's Mod as well as all the source games I have mentioned installed and also 7-Zip installed.

### How to install Source SDK 2013 Multiplayer
1. Navigate to your steam library and make sure you have tools checked in your filters
2. Open `UNCATEGORIZED` category and find `Source SDK 2013 Multiplayer`
3. Click on `INSTALL` button then on `NEXT` and wait for it to download

4. **YOU MUST RUN HAMMER FROM SOURCE SDK 2013 MULTIPLAYER NOW BEFORE CONTINUING** (Steps below explain how to do this)
5. Right click on `Source SDK 2013 Multiplayer` and hover over `Manage` and then click `Browse local files`
![Image 2](./images/2.png)
6. Navigate into `bin` folder and double click `hammer.exe`, small window should pop out, choose `Half-Life 2`
7. When hammer opens and fully initializes, close it

### (Optional) How to install Slammin' Tools?
**Slammin' Tools are not neccessery but are good thing to have especially if you are compiling Statua's maps.**

1. Navigate to this [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/17pQY8wDkednZi0kMZOSpAtNBNmFWm6GJ) and and download file ending with `.7z`
![Image 4](./images/4.png)
2. Once downloaded, open archive and drag and drop the files into `bin` folder of `Source SDK 2013 Multiplayer` (it will ask you if you want to override some files and you have to click yes)
![Image 5](./images/5.png)
![Image 6](./images/6.png)
3. Now repeat step `6` and `7` of installing `Source SDK 2013 Multiplayer`

## Installing and configuring Hammer++
Now without any more bullshitting as I already hate myself to the point of punching myself in the face, we get to grand finale which is installing and configuring Hammer++.

### Installing
1. Navigate to this [link](https://ficool2.github.io/HammerPlusPlus-Website/pages/download.html) and download for version for `Source SDK 2013 Multiplayer`
![Image 7](./images/7.png)
2. Once downloaded, open archive and navigate inside folder you see and into `bin` folder inside then drag and drop the files into `bin` folder of `Source SDK 2013 Multiplayer`
![Image 8](./images/8.png)
![Image 9](./images/9.png)
3. Now repeat step `6` and `7` of installing `Source SDK 2013 Multiplayer`

### Configuring
This part of the tutorial will be written only, so read it carefully and every step written here is very important.

1. Navigate into root folder of `Source SDK 2013 Multiplayer` and open folder named `hl2`
2. Open `gameinfo.txt` with the editor of your choice
3. You will add those lines to your `gameinfo.txt`, **Don't forget to change "<Steam's common folder>" to proper path**
```
// Game contents
game				"<Steam's common folder>/GarrysMod/garrysmod/garrysmod.vpk"
game				"<Steam's common folder>/Counter-Strike Source/cstrike"
game				"<Steam's common folder>/Half-Life 2/episodic"
game				"<Steam's common folder>/Half-Life 2/ep2"
game				"<Steam's common folder>/Half-Life 2/lostcoast"
game				"<Steam's common folder>/Half-Life 2 Deathmatch/hl2mp"
game				"<Steam's common folder>/infra/infra"
game				"<Steam's common folder>/Black Mesa/bms"
```
You add them after those lines:
```
// Where the game's binaries are
gamebin				hl2/bin
platform			|all_source_engine_paths|platform
```
Those lines mount contents from source games, list goes as follow
- Garry's Mod
- Counter-Strike:Source
- Half-Life 2: Episode One
- Half-Life 2: Episode Two
- Half-Life 2: Lost Coast
- Half-Life 2: Deathmatch
- Infra
- Black Mesa

4. Now navigate into root folder of `Source SDK 2013 Multiplayer` and then into bin folder
5. Double click `hammerplusplus.exe` and when small window appear you have to choose `Half-Life 2`, yes you won't be adding `Garry's Mod` into that list
6. Once hammer is open you have to open `Tools` dropdown and from there choose `Options...`
7. New window will appear, click on `Game Configurations` and you will see small button `Add` click it
8. Navigate into your `Garry's Mod` root folder and then into `bin` folder and find there file called `garrysmod.fgd` and load it
9. Click on the `2D Views` tab and in `Options` section tick everything in the right column
10. In `Build Programs` tab you are going to change path of `Game executable` to `<Garry's Mod root folder>/hl2.exe`
11. In `Build Programs` tab you are going to change path of `Maps Folder` to `<Garry's Mod root folder>/garrysmod/maps`
12. In `Hammer++` disable Anisotropic Filtering

## Example `gameinfo.txt`
```
"GameInfo"
{
	game 		"HALF-LIFE 2"
	title 		"HALF-LIFE'"
	type		singleplayer_only
	supportsvr	1

	FileSystem
	{
		SteamAppId				220		// This will mount all the GCFs we need (240=CS:S, 220=HL2).
		
		//
		// The code that loads this file automatically does a few things here:
		//
		// 1. For each "Game" search path, it adds a "GameBin" path, in <dir>\bin
		// 2. For each "Game" search path, it adds another "Game" path in front of it with _<langage> at the end.
		//    For example: c:\hl2\cstrike on a french machine would get a c:\hl2\cstrike_french path added to it.
		// 3. For the first "Game" search path, it adds a search path called "MOD".
		// 4. For the first "Game" search path, it adds a search path called "DEFAULT_WRITE_PATH".
		//

		//
		// Search paths are relative to the base directory, which is where hl2.exe is found.
		//
		// |gameinfo_path| points at the directory where gameinfo.txt is.
		// We always want to mount that directory relative to gameinfo.txt, so
		// people can mount stuff in c:\mymod, and the main game resources are in
		// someplace like c:\program files\valve\steam\steamapps\half-life 2.
		//
		SearchPaths
		{
			// First, mount all user customizations.  This will search for VPKs and subfolders
			// and mount them in alphabetical order.  The easiest way to distribute a mod is to
			// pack up the custom content into a VPK.  To "install" a mod, just drop it in this
			// folder.
			//
			// Note that this folder is scanned only when the game is booted.
			game+mod			hl2/custom/*

			// We search VPK files before ordinary folders, because most files will be found in
			// VPK and we can avoid making thousands of file system calls to attempt to open files
			// in folders where they don't exist.  (Searching a VPK is much faster than making an operating
			// system call.)
			game_lv				hl2/hl2_lv.vpk
			game+mod			hl2/hl2_sound_vo_english.vpk
			game+mod			hl2/hl2_pak.vpk
			game				|all_source_engine_paths|hl2/hl2_textures.vpk
			game				|all_source_engine_paths|hl2/hl2_sound_misc.vpk
			game				|all_source_engine_paths|hl2/hl2_misc.vpk
			platform			|all_source_engine_paths|platform/platform_misc.vpk

			// Now search loose files.  We'll set the directory containing the gameinfo.txt file
			// as the first "mod" search path (after any user customizations).  This is also the one
			// that's used when writing to the "mod" path.
			mod+mod_write+default_write_path		|gameinfo_path|.

			// Add the HL2 directory as a game search path.  This is also where where writes
			// to the "game" path go.
			game+game_write		hl2

			// Where the game's binaries are
			gamebin				hl2/bin

			// Last, mount in shared HL2 loose files
			game				|all_source_engine_paths|hl2
			platform			|all_source_engine_paths|platform

			// Source game contents
			game				"|all_source_engine_paths|../GarrysMod/garrysmod/garrysmod.vpk"
			game				"|all_source_engine_paths|../Counter-Strike Source/cstrike"
			game				"|all_source_engine_paths|../Half-Life 2/episodic"
			game				"|all_source_engine_paths|../Half-Life 2/ep2"
			game				"|all_source_engine_paths|../Half-Life 2/lostcoast"
			game				"|all_source_engine_paths|../Half-Life 2 Deathmatch/hl2mp"
			game				"|all_source_engine_paths|../infra/infra"
			game				"|all_source_engine_paths|../Black Mesa/bms"

			// Other contents
			// game				"E:/gmod/maps/rp_riverden/content/"
		}
	}
}

```

## Last words
Now you are ready to use Hammer++ and it should work. The only problem you have is that you have to double mount contents as hammer++ does not support Garry's Mod mounting way for now. So if you are using hammer++ you are most propably familiar with `mount.cfg` of gmod, so to mount content into hammer++ you have to mount it in `gameinfo.txt` you edited earlier and add right after those lines you added earlier `game "<path to your content>"`. If you think that I could improve something then messege me on github or you can ping me on discord (ParSec#4563) on [Statua Mapping](https://discord.gg/3Uq4WKNRuF) server, I do recommend you drop by and say hello, a lot of people there can help you with a lot of your problems.

Now if you don't mind I'm gonna shoot myself in the face.
Oh and I couldn't forget about you CoolGuy for asking me everyday the same question when will I make it and reminding me how disorganized I am.
