## Installing and configuring Hammer++
Now without any more bullshitting as I already hate myself to the point of punching myself in the face, we get to grand finale which is installing and configuring Hammer++.

### Installing
1. Navigate to this [link](https://ficool2.github.io/HammerPlusPlus-Website/pages/download.html) and download for version for `Source SDK 2013 Multiplayer`
![Image 7](./images/7.png)
2. Once downloaded, open archive and navigate inside folder you see and into `bin` folder inside then drag and drop the files into `bin` folder of `Source SDK 2013 Multiplayer`
![Image 8](./images/8.png)
![Image 9](./images/9.png)
3. Now repeat step `6` and `7` of installing `Source SDK 2013 Multiplayer`

### Configuring
This part of the tutorial will be written only, so read it carefully and every step written here is very important.

1. Navigate into root folder of `Source SDK 2013 Multiplayer` and open folder named `hl2`
2. Open `gameinfo.txt` with the editor of your choice
3. You will add those lines to your `gameinfo.txt`, **Don't forget to change "<Steam's common folder>" to proper path**
```
			// Game contents
			game				"<Steam's common folder>/Counter-Strike Source/cstrike/cstrike_pak.vpk"
			game				"<Steam's common folder>/Half-Life 2/episodic/ep1_pak.vpk"
			game				"<Steam's common folder>/Half-Life 2/ep2/ep2_pak.vpk"
			game				"<Steam's common folder>/Half-Life 2/lostcoast/lostcoast_pak.vpk"
			game				"<Steam's common folder>/Half-Life 2 Deathmatch/hl2mp/hl2mp_pak.vpk"
			game				"<Steam's common folder>/infra/infra/pak01.vpk"
			game				"<Steam's common folder>/GarrysMod/garrysmod/garrysmod.vpk"
```
You add them after those lines:
```
			// Where the game's binaries are
			gamebin				hl2/bin
			platform			|all_source_engine_paths|platform
```
Those lines mount contents from source games, list goes as follow
- Counter-Strike:Source
- Half-Life 2: Episode One
- Half-Life 2: Episode Two
- Half-Life 2: Lost Coast
- Half-Life 2: Deathmatch
- Infra
- Garry's Mod

4. Now navigate into root folder of `Source SDK 2013 Multiplayer` and then into bin folder
5. Double click `hammerplusplus.exe` and when small window appear you have to choose `Half-Life 2`, yes you won't be adding `Garry's Mod` into that list
6. Once hammer is open you have to open `Tools` dropdown and from there choose `Options...`
7. New window will appear, click on `Game Configurations` and you will see small button `Add` click it
8. Navigate into your `Garry's Mod` root folder and then into `bin` folder and find there file called `garrysmod.fgd` and load it
9. Click on the `2D Views` tab and in `Options` section tick everything in the right column
10. In `Build Programs` tab you are going to change path of `Game executable` to `<Garry's Mod root folder>/hl2.exe`
11. In `Build Programs` tab you are going to change path of `Maps Folder` to `<Garry's Mod root folder>/garrysmod/maps`
12. In `Hammer++` disable Anisotropic Filtering

## Last words
Now you are ready to use Hammer++ and it should work. The only problem you have is that you have to double mount contents as hammer++ does not support Garry's Mod mounting way for now. So if you are using hammer++ you are most propably familiar with `mount.cfg` of gmod, so to mount content into hammer++ you have to mount it in `gameinfo.txt` you edited earlier and add right after those lines you added earlier `game "<path to your content>"`. If you think that I could improve something then messege me on github or you can ping me on discord (ParSec#4563) on [Statua Mapping](https://discord.gg/3Uq4WKNRuF) server, I do recommend you drop by and say hello, a lot of people there can help you with a lot of your problems.

Now if you don't mind I'm gonna shoot myself in the face.
Oh and I couldn't forget about you CoolGuy for asking me everyday the same question when will I make it and reminding me how disorganized I am.
